Simple Restaurant Scorer
========================

This repository contains the business logic for inferring restaurant "scores" using tips from transaction data.
It's meant to be used in conjunction with the [restaurant-score-mapreduce](https://github.com/IntersysConsulting/restaurant-score-mapreduce) code to be run on Hadoop.

It also contains a package for generating the data for this example.
